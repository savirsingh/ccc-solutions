# CCC Solutions

Canadian Computing Competition solutions in C++, Python, Java. I started solving these problems in December 2021 (in Grade 9).

This repository contains all of my solutions to CCC problems from 2000 to 2023, as well as other fun problems to get you thinking (stored [right here](https://github.com/savirsingh/ccc-solutions/tree/main/Other%20Preparation)).

I'm most comfortable with Python and C++. C++ is now my main programming language for competitive programming.

Email kopichiki@gmail.com if you have any questions.

You can find all of these problems at https://dmoj.ca or https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca.
