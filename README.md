# CCC Solutions

Canadian Computing Competition solutions in Python, C++, and Java.

I'm most comfortable with Python.
I've written some solutions in C++/Java just in case they have low time limits (C++ is faster than Java which is faster than Python).

My DMOJ username is kopichiki.

Email kopichiki@gmail.com if you have any questions.

You can find all of these problems at https://dmoj.ca or https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca

The CCC can be difficult for a lot of people, but continue practicing and you might even be able to achieve a perfect score.

Note: I generally stuff my code with loops, so it may be inefficient :/
